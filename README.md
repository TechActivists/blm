# Description
# At the most visible apex of systemic racism, there is police brutality against mostly African Americans. However, within this group, public outrage, media attention, and calls for change are done solely in the names of Black men. It is true that Black men face the barrel of brutality's gun more often than Black women. Yet, it is Black women who brought this ancient American injustice to the negotiation table while facing the barrel themselves.Our app will be a modifiable and searchable database focusing on Black women killed by police. Users will be able to search for victims of police brutality and add tips for those not yet accounted for. If time permits, we will add the ability to compare the social media coverage of Black men vs Black women who were killed under similar circumstances.
