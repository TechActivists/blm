            <p class="uk-clearfix victimSummary">McKenna, who had schizophrenia, was tasered four times for being non-compliant with deputies. She later went into cardiac arrest due to a combination of the tasering, psychoactive medications and what the medical examiner controversially termed 'excited delirium'. Tasers were found to have played a role in her death, but no criminal charges were filed. The jail has since banned the use of Tasers.</p>
